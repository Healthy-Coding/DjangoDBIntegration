            <h3>College Board</h3>
            <p> Our goal is to make diversity and inclusion resources more accessible to students, faculty, and consultants about post-secondary education. For each university, we map diversity statistics relative to state demographics, and we show relative cost depending on family income. We also show socio-economic diversity by listing the percent of students that receive Pell grants, which indicates the percent of student body whose family income makes less than $40k.
                <br>
                <br> Beyong just numbers, we also hope to foster discussion concerning social issues on campuses. We have a "Resources" tab, where individuals can list problematic statements, and other people in the UAP community can respond with facts, statistics, and research publications. Our goal is create a centralized database where people around the world can create high quality counter arguments against oppressive, problematic paradigms.</p>
